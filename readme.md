# Setup

* racket downloaded
* added to path
* `racket` to run repl, `racket $filename` to run the interpreter, `(exit)` to exit repl

# types of interpreters
* `applicative-order` - traditional eval. Evaluation will "evaluate the arguments and then apply".
* `normal order` - lazy. “fully expand and then reduce”
