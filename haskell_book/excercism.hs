-- If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
-- If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
-- If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
-- If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

-- The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for 
-- the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.
--  Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric 
--  defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

-- Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its Cartesian coordinates x and y, 
-- where x and y are real), 
-- returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

-- The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:
-- Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. 
-- If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. 
--The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with,you will always reach 1 eventually.
-- Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.
-- n = 12 -> 9 steps
